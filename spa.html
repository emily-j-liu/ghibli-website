    <p>A 2001 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Spirited Away tells the story of
      Chihiro "Sen" Ogino, a ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighborhood, inadvertently enters the world
      of kami (spirits of Japanese Shinto folklore). After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro
      takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to the human
      world. (Taken from: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away" target=”_blank” attribute>Wikipedia</a>)
